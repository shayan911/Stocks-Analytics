# Stocks-Analytics

In this data science project, we utilized various Python libraries, including **yfinance** and **BeautifulSoup**, to extract historical financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reporting, for popular stocks including Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. The data was then visualized using the **Plotly** library to identify patterns and trends. This project served as an introduction to utilizing these libraries for financial data extraction and visualization.

#### Key Introductions:

-yfinance (A Python package that allows developers to easily access and analyze financial data from the Yahoo Finance website.)

-BeautifulSoup (A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It creates parse trees from page source code that is helpful to extract the data easily)

-plotly (A Python library that allows developers to create interactive, web-based visualizations of data. It can be used to create a wide variety of charts and plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and more.)
